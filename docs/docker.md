# Docker Support

## Building the Docker image

```
$ chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh

$ ./scripts/docker_build.sh
```

## Running a Docker container from the built image

```
$ ./scripts/docker_run.sh
```
The **docker_run.sh** script is an example. Please change it as your need. The script assumes the **/dev/video0** camera device for the input.
